# TruckAPI

This is a simple .NET 8 Web API project that manages a fleet of vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks. The project follows clean architecture principles and includes unit tests using xUnit, FluentAssertions, and Bogus.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Insert a new vehicle
- Update vehicle color by chassis ID
- List all vehicles
- Get vehicle details by chassis ID
- In-memory data store (no database required)
- Modular architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)

---

## âœ… Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (with ASP.NET and test tools workloads)
- Optional: `curl` or Postman for testing the API

---

## Example of a working payload for the POST endpoint:

the field "type" will only accept "car","bus" or "truck" as a value.
{
"series": "cr25",
"number": 0,
"type": "car",
"color": "blue"
}

ðŸ§  Notes
No external database required â€” data is stored in memory.

Ideal for testing API patterns, unit testing, and clean code practices.

Ready to evolve to use EF Core and MySQL if needed.
